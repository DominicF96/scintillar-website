## Working with Layers

### Switching Between Layers
Navigate between layers using the sidebar navigation or the layer selector in the main interface.

### Customizing Layer Views
Each layer offers customization options:
- Filter data by date range, category, or importance
- Adjust visualization styles and colors  
- Configure display density and detail levels
- Set up custom alerts and notifications

### Layer Interactions
Layers can be combined and overlaid to provide comprehensive insights:
- Cross-reference data between layers

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a single layer to understand the data
2. **Layer Gradually**: Add additional layers as needed for context
3. **Customize Views**: Adjust settings to match your workflow
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep layer data current for accurate insights
